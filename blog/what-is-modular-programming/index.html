                The concept of modular programming is inspired from <span class="link1"><a

                </span> and basically is <strong>decomposing complex
                    & large softwares</strong> into <strong>simples modules</strong> for an easy and faster
                implementation by allowing parallel
                developement of different parts of the system .

            <div class="paragraph hp1">
                Modularity refers to the <strong>division of software</strong> into <strong>separate modules</strong>
                which are <strong>differently named and
                    addressed</strong> and are integrated later on in order to obtain the completely functional software
                .

                it allows a program to be intellectually manageable , while single large programs are difficult to
                understand
                and read .

                <b> Modularity </b>

                is all about making blocks, and each block is made with the help of other blocks. Every block in itself
                is solid and testable and can be stacked together to create an entire application. Therefore, thinking
                about the concept of modularity is also like building the whole architecture of the application.

                <p><strong>Code is easier to read - </strong> Working on modular programming makes code easier to read
                    because functions
                    perform different tasks as compared to monolithic codes.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Code is easier to test -</strong> In software, some functions perform fewer tasks and also
                    functions that
                    perform numerous tasks. If the software is easily split using modules, it becomes easier to test.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Reusability -</strong> There are times where a piece of code is implemented everywhere in our
                    program. Instead
                    of copying and pasting it, again and again, modularity gives us the advantage of reusability so that
                    we can pull our code from anywhere using interfaces or libraries. The concept of reusability also
                    reduces the size of our program.</p>
                <p><strong>Faster fixes -</strong> Suppose there is an error in the payment options in any application,
                    and the bug needs to be removed. Modularity can be a great help because we know that there will be a
                    separate function
                    that will contain the code of payments, and only that function will only be rectified. Thus using
                    modules to find and fixing bugs becomes much more smooth and maintainable.</p>

                <p><strong>Easy collaboration -</strong> Different developers work on a single piece of code in the
                    team. There are chances of conflicts when there's a git merge. This conflict can be reduced if the
                    code is split between more functions, files, repos, etc. We can also provide ownership to specific
                    code modules, where a team member can break them down into smaller tasks.</p>

                <li class="paragraph"> Some modules may partly repeat the task performed by other modules. Hence,
                    Modular programs need more memory space and extra time for execution
                </li>


                <li class="paragraph"> It reduces the program's efficiency because testing and debugging are
                    time-consuming, where each function contains a thousand lines of code

                There is some concepts you should know about them like <strong>decoupling</strong> ,
                <strong>coupling</strong> & <strong>cohesion :</strong>

            <ul>
